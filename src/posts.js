        title: "Decades-long research reveals new understanding of how climate change may impact caches of Arctic soil carbon",
        text: "Utilizing one of the longest-running ecosystem experiments in the Arctic, a Colorado State University-led team of researchers has developed a better understanding of the interplay among plants, microbes and soil nutrients â€” findings that offer new insight into how critical carbon deposits may be released from thawing Arctic permafrost. Decades-long research reveals new understanding of how climate change may impact caches of Arctic soil carbon",
